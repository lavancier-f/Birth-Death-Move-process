The data consist of a sequence of 1199 frames showing the locations of two types of proteins inside a living cell, namely Langerin and Rab11 proteins, both being involved in exocytosis mechanisms in cells.

- The raw sequence for each type of protein is: M10_LangerinYFp_09.mp4 and M10_Rab11mCherry_09.mp4

- The post-processed sequences by a Gaussian filtering are: M10_LangerinYFp_09_GaussianWeights.mp4 and M10_Rab11mCherry_09_GaussianWeights.mp4

- The result of proteins tracking (by Utrack) for the previous sequences are: Utrack_Langerin_GaussianWeights.mp4 and Utrack_Rab11_GaussianWeights.mp4
